# We have moved #

Due [Google Code deprecating downloads](http://google-opensource.blogspot.fi/2013/05/a-change-to-google-code-download-service.html), SSHLibrary installation packages are hosted at _**[PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/robotframework-sshlibrary)**_ since version 2.0. Older downloads [are still available here if needed](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework-sshlibrary/downloads/list?can=1).

Notice that SSHLibrary project itself has also been moved to _**[GitHub](https://github.com/robotframework/SSHLibrary)**_.

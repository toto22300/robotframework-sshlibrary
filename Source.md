# We have moved #

SSHLibrary project has been moved to _**[GitHub](https://github.com/robotframework/SSHLibrary)**_. Please use the services there to view the code, fork it, etc.

You can still [browse](http://code.google.com/p/robotframework-sshlibrary/source/browse/) the old repository if needed. Because the new repository contains all history, there should rarely be any need for that, though.

## Introduction ##

SSHLibrary is a [Robot Framework](http://code.google.com/p/robotframework) test library for SSH and SFTP.

The library has the following main usages:
  * Executing the commands on the remote machine, either with blocking or non-blocking behaviour
  * Writing and reading in an interactive session
  * Transferring files and directories over SFTP
  * Ensuring that files or directories exist on the remote machine

## Instructions ##

SSHLibrary works both with Python and Jython interpreters. See [the installation instructions](InstallationInstructions.md) for a step by step guide.

The library usage, including examples, is documented in [the keyword documentation](KeywordDocumentation.md).

## Downloads ##

Starting from SSHLibrary 2.0, the source distributions are hosted at [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/robotframework-sshlibrary).
